1.  Introduction

   This document lays a set of rules for how to define COSE profiles.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Rules

   A COSE profile:

   *  MUST be specified in a document

   *  MUST NOT change the syntax or semantics of any already defined
      header attribute

   *  MAY define new header attributes

      -  if so, it MUST provide their definition in the same document

   *  MUST use CDDL [RFC8610] to fully specify the syntax rules for the
      profile

   *  MUST use the COSE_profile header attribute in the protected header

      -  The value of COSE_profile MUST be global unique via:

         o  IANA registry

         o  using an OID [RFC9090], URI [STD66] or CRI
            [I-D.ietf-core-href]

         o  using a UUID [RFC4122]

      -  The chosen value SHOULD be appropriate for the intended usage
         scope (e.g., a small value when used in constrained node
         environments)

   *  MAY define its own COSE tag

   *  SHOULD define its complementary media-type and content-format

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
